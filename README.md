Project Title: Calories Burnt Prediction

Description:
This project aims to predict the number of calories burned during physical activity using machine learning techniques. An XGBoost Regressor model is employed to establish a relationship between various input features

Prerequisites:
 * Python: Ensure you have Python 3.6 or later installed.
 * Libraries:
   * pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
   * numpy: For numerical operations
   * xgboost: For implementing the XGBoost algorithm.
   * matplotlib: For data visualization (optional).
   * seaborn: For advanced data visualization (optional).
  
Installation:
 * Install the required libraries using pip:

Dataset:
 * Data Source:Kaggle 
 * Format:CSV
 * Features: age, height, weight, duration, body temp
 * Target Variable: excercise data: calories

Data Preprocessing:
 * Loading: Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
 * Cleaning: Handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the data.

Model Training:
 * Split Data: Divide the dataset into training and testing sets.
 * Initialize Model: Create an XGBoost Regressor instance.
 * Train Model: Fit the model to the training data.

Model Evaluation:
 * Predictions: Make predictions on the testing set.
 * Metrics: Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics eg (Mean Absolute Error)
